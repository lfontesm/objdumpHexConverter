# objdumpHexConverter
Objdump converter from hex to decimal

A very simple python script to convert the hexadecimal representation from objdump in function offsets to decimal, since by default gdb uses decimal, it's easier to reverse engineer without constantly throwing functions offsets at a hex converter :D
